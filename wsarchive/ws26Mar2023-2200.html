<body>
	<h1>Scenery in An Inspector Calls</h1>
	<p>Before we delve into the activities, let's take a look at some key terms that we'll be using.</p>
	
	<h2>Key Terms</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Set Design - the process of designing and creating the physical space where the play will be performed</li>
		<li>Staging - the way in which the actors are arranged on the stage in relation to each other and to the set</li>
		<li>Props - items used by actors during the play to help tell the story e.g. furniture, cutlery, telephone</li>
		<li>Lighting - the use of light to create mood, atmosphere and focus on characters</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Questions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>What is set design?</li>
		<li>What is the purpose of staging?</li>
		<li>Can props be used to give clues to the audience about upcoming events?</li>
		<li>How can lighting be used to enhance the performance?</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Set Design Exercise</h2>
	<p>Your task is to design a set for An Inspector Calls. Draw a sketch of the set and include labels for any props that will be used. Remember, the set should reflect the time period and the theme of the play.</p>
	
	<h2>Quotation Analysis</h2>
	<p>Choose one of the quotes below and explain how it relates to the setting of the play.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>"The dining-room of a fairly large suburban house, belonging to a prosperous manufacturer."</li>
		<li>"The lighting should be pink and intimate until the Inspector arrives, and then it should be brighter and harder."</li>
		<li>"The general effect is substantial and heavily comfortable, but not cozy and homelike."</li>
		<li>"The street is only lightly cobbled and the houses are dark and rather dingy."</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Contextual Research Task</h2>
	<p>Research the social and political climate of Britain during the time period in which An Inspector Calls is set (1912). Write a paragraph explaining how this climate is reflected in the play.</p>
	
	<h2>Open-Ended Research Task</h2>
	<p>Research the set designs used in different productions of An Inspector Calls. Write a paragraph discussing the similarities and differences between the designs and explain how they contribute to the overall message of the play.</p>
