</head>
<body>
	<h1>🌪️ The Formation of Tornadoes</h1>
	<p>Tornadoes are violent rotating columns of air that occur in many parts of the world. Here are some key terms to know:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Tornado</b>: A violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm cloud to the ground.</li>
		<li><b>Vortex</b>: The spinning motion of air in a tornado.</li>
		<li><b>Funnel Cloud</b>: A rotating cone-shaped column of air that extends from the base of a cloud but doesn't reach the ground yet.</li>
		<li><b>Mesocyclone</b>: A large rotating updraft in a thunderstorm that can lead to tornado formation.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Questions:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>What is a tornado?</li>
		<li>What is a funnel cloud?</li>
		<li>What is a mesocyclone and how does it lead to tornado formation?</li>
		<li>Where around the world do tornadoes occur?</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Poster Task:</h2>
	<p>Your task is to design a poster warning about the dangers of tornadoes. You may include graphics, colors, and any other elements you think are appropriate to get your message across. Make sure your poster is clear and informative.</p>

	<h2>Research Task:</h2>
	<p>Choose one of the following research tasks:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>What are some of the most destructive tornadoes in history? Where and when did they occur, and what were their effects?</li>
		<li>What are some of the best ways to stay safe during a tornado? What steps can individuals and communities take to prepare for these severe weather events?</li>
		<li>What are the latest technologies and methods for predicting tornadoes? How effective have these methods been, and what are the challenges that meteorologists face in this area?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Write a short essay (approximately 500 words) summarizing your research findings. Be sure to cite your sources appropriately.</p>
