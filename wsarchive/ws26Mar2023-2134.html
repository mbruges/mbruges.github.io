    <h1>Macbeth Act 1</h1>
    <p>Macbeth is a tragedy play written by William Shakespeare. It tells the story of a Scottish warrior, Macbeth, who receives a prophecy from three witches that he will become the king of Scotland. Encouraged by his ambitious wife, Lady Macbeth, Macbeth commits a series of murders in order to fulfill the prophecy. Act 1 of the play sets the stage for the rest of the story and introduces several major characters and themes.</p>
    
    <h2>Short Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Who are the three witches and what do they prophesy to Macbeth?</li>

      <li>Why does Macbeth see a hallucination of a dagger before he murders King Duncan?</li>
      <li>What happens to the original Thane of Cawdor and why?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Quotation Analysis</h2>
    <p>Read the following quote from Act 1, Scene 7 and answer the questions that follow:</p>

    </blockquote>

      <li>What does Macbeth mean by "spur"?</li>
      <li>What does Macbeth mean by "vaulting ambition"?</li>
      <li>How does this quote reveal Macbeth's character?</li>
    </ol>

      <li>What role did James I play in the production of the play?</li>
      <li>How did Shakespeare alter the historical events upon which Macbeth is based?</li>
    </ol>
