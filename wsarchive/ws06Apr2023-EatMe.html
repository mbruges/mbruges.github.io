		<h2>Eat Me - Patience Agbabi</h2>
		<p>When I hit thirty, he brought me a cake, <br> three layers of icing, home-made, <br> a candle for each stone in
			weight.<br><br>The icing was white but the letters were pink, <br> they said, eat me. And I ate, did <br> what I was
			told. Didn‚Äôt even taste it.<br><br>Then he asked me to get up and walk <br> round the bed so he could watch my broad
			<br> belly wobble, hips judder like a juggernaut. <br> The bigger the better, he‚Äôd say, I like <br> big girls, soft
			girls, girls I can burrow inside <br> with multiple chins, masses of cellulite.<br><br>I was his Jacuzzi. But he was
			my cook, <br> my only pleasure the rush of fast food, <br> his pleasure, to watch me swell like forbidden
			fruit.<br><br>His breadfruit. His desert island after shipwreck. <br> Or a beached whale on a king-size bed <br>
			craving a wave. I was a tidal wave of flesh<br><br>too fat to leave, too fat to buy a pint of full-fat milk, <br>
			too fat to use fat as an emotional shield, <br> too fat to be called chubby, cuddly, big-built.<br><br>The day I hit
			thirty-nine, I allowed him to stroke <br> my globe of a cheek. His flesh, my flesh flowed. <br> He said, Open wide,
			poured olive oil down my throat.<br><br>Soon you‚Äôll be forty‚Ä¶ he whispered, and how <br> could I not roll over on
			top. I rolled and he drowned <br> in my flesh. I drowned his dying sentence out.<br><br>I left him there for six
			hours that felt like a week. <br> His mouth slightly open, his eyes bulging with greed. <br> There was nothing else
			left in the house to eat.</p>
