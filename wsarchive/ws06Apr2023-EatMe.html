		<h2>Eat Me - Patience Agbabi</h2>
		<p>When I hit thirty, he brought me a cake, <br> three layers of icing, home-made, <br> a candle for each stone in
			weight.<br><br>The icing was white but the letters were pink, <br> they said, eat me. And I ate, did <br> what I was
			told. Didn‚Äôt even taste it.<br><br>Then he asked me to get up and walk <br> round the bed so he could watch my broad
			<br> belly wobble, hips judder like a juggernaut. <br> The bigger the better, he‚Äôd say, I like <br> big girls, soft
			girls, girls I can burrow inside <br> with multiple chins, masses of cellulite.<br><br>I was his Jacuzzi. But he was
			my cook, <br> my only pleasure the rush of fast food, <br> his pleasure, to watch me swell like forbidden
			fruit.<br><br>His breadfruit. His desert island after shipwreck. <br> Or a beached whale on a king-size bed <br>
			craving a wave. I was a tidal wave of flesh<br><br>too fat to leave, too fat to buy a pint of full-fat milk, <br>
			too fat to use fat as an emotional shield, <br> too fat to be called chubby, cuddly, big-built.<br><br>The day I hit
			thirty-nine, I allowed him to stroke <br> my globe of a cheek. His flesh, my flesh flowed. <br> He said, Open wide,
			poured olive oil down my throat.<br><br>Soon you‚Äôll be forty‚Ä¶ he whispered, and how <br> could I not roll over on
			top. I rolled and he drowned <br> in my flesh. I drowned his dying sentence out.<br><br>I left him there for six
			hours that felt like a week. <br> His mouth slightly open, his eyes bulging with greed. <br> There was nothing else
			left in the house to eat.</p>

<h2>Comprehension</h2>
<p>Answer the following questions about the poem:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What gift does the man give the speaker on her 30th birthday? Why is this ironic?</li>
	<li>How does the man's language show his objectification of the speaker?</li>
	<li>Why does the speaker say "I was his Jacuzzi"? What metaphor is being used here?</li>
	<li>How does the ending subvert the reader's expectations?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Language analysis</h2>
<p>Discuss the effectiveness of the following language features in the poem:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The repetition of "eat me"</li>
	<li>The use of similes and metaphors to describe the speaker, e.g. "beached whale", "tidal wave of flesh"</li>
	<li>The increasing length of lines, reflecting the speaker's increasing size</li>
	<li>The casual, imperative tone of the man's language</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The poem explores themes of objectification, abuse and control. Discuss how these themes are conveyed through the
	metaphor of eating and the speaker's increasing size.</p>
<p>You could consider:
<ul>
	<li>The man's language in coercing the speaker to eat and gain weight</li>
	<li>The pleasure he gains from watching her size increase</li>
	<li>The ways in which the speaker's expanding body represents her loss of control and independence</li>
	<li>How the ending suggests the speaker regaining power over the man</li>
</ul>
