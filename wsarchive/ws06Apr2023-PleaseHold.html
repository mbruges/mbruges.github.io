	<h2>Please Hold</h2>
	<p>This is the future, my wife says. <br> We are already there, and it‚Äôs the same <br> as the present.
		Your future, here, she says. <br> And I‚Äôm talking to a robot on the phone. <br> The robot is giving me countless
		options, <br> none of which answer to my needs. <br> Wonderful, says the robot <br> when I give him my telephone
		number. <br> And Great, says the robot <br> when I give him my account number. <br> I have a wonderful telephone
		number <br> and a great account number, <br> but I can find nothing to meet my needs <br> on the telephone, and into
		my account <br> (which is really the robot‚Äôs account) <br> goes money, my money, to pay for nothing. <br> I‚Äôm paying
		a robot for doing nothing. <br> This call is free of charge, says the mind-reading robot. <br> Yes but I'm paying
		for it, I shout, <br> out of my wonderful account <br> into my great telephone bill. <br> Wonderful, says the robot.
		<br> And my wife says, This is the future. <br> I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt understand, says the robot. <br> Please say Yes
		or No. <br> Or you can say Repeat or Menu. <br> You can say Yes, No, Repeat or Menu, <br> Or you can say Agent if
		you‚Äôd like to talk <br> to someone real, who is just as robotic. <br> I scream Agent! and am cut off, <br> and my
		wife says, This is the future. <br> We are already there and it‚Äôs the same <br> as the present. Your future, here,
		she says. <br> And I‚Äôm talking to a robot on the phone, <br> and he is giving me no options <br> in the guise of
		countless alternatives. <br> We appreciate your patience. Please hold. <br> <a data-tooltip="A piece of music by Mozart, often used as the 'hold' music by call centres" class="tooltipdata">Eine Kleine Nachtmusik</a>. Please hold.
		<br> Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. Please hold. <br> Eine fucking Kleine Nachtmusik. <br> And the robot transfers me to
		himself. <br> Your call is important to us, he says. <br> And my translator says, This means <br> your call is not
		important to them. <br> And my wife says, This is the future. <br> And my translator says, Please hold <br> means
		that, for all your accomplishments, <br> the only way you can now meet your needs <br> is by looting. Wonderful,
		says the robot<br><br>Please hold. Please grow old. Please grow cold. <br> Please do what you‚Äôre told. Grow old.
		Grow cold. <br> This is the future. Please hold.</p>
