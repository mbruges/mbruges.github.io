		<h2>Ode to a Grayson Perry Urn</h2>
		<p>Hello! What's all this here? A kitschy vase <br> some Shirley Temple manqu√© has knocked out <br> delineating tales of
			kids in cars <br> on crap estates, the Burberry clad louts <br> who flail their motors through the smoky night <br>
			from Manchester to Motherwell or Slough, <br> creating bedlam on the Queen's highway. <br> Your gaudy evocation can,
			somehow, <br> conjure the scene without inducing fright, <br> as would a Daily Express expos√©, <br> can bring to
			mind the throaty turbo roar <br> of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point, <br> the joyful throb of UK garage or
			<br> of house imported from the continent <br> and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm - <br> the screech of tyres
			and the nervous squeals <br> of girls, too young to quite appreciate <br> the peril they are in, are heard, but
			these wheels <br> will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm <br> befall these children. They will stay out
			late<br><br>forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy, <br> on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed <br> the back lanes,
			the urban gyratory, <br> the wide motorways, never having need <br> to race back home, for work next day, to bed.
			<br> Each girl is buff, each geezer toned and strong, <br> charged with pulsing juice which, even yet, <br> fills
			every pair of Calvin‚Äôs and each thong, <br> never to be deflated, given head <br> in crude games of chlamydia
			roulette.<br><br>Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge, <br> to toast them in Buckfast and Diamond White:
			<br> rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge <br> them on to pull more burn-outs or to write <br> their donut
			Os, as signature, upon <br> the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets. <br> There dogs set up a row and curtains
			twitch <br> as pensioners and parents telephone <br> the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace - <br> tranquility,
			though, is for the rich. <br> And so, millennia hence, you garish crock, <br> when all context is lost, galleries
			razed <br> to level dust and we're long in the box, <br> will future poets look on you amazed, <br> speculate how
			children might have lived when <br> you were fired, lives so free and bountiful <br> and there, beneath a sun a
			little colder, <br> declare How happy were those creatures then, <br> who knew the truth was all negotiable <br> and
			beauty in the gift of the beholder.</p>
