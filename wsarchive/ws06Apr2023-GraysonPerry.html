	<h1>Exploring: 'Ode to a Grayson Perry Urn' üè∫</h1>
	<i><p>To understand this poem, it's worth reading up on the phenomenon of the <b>chav</b>; a term that's (rightly)  fallen out of usage now, but was ubiqitous in the British tabloids during late Nineties and Noughties to describe certain parts of working class communities.</p>

		<h2>Ode to a Grayson Perry Urn</h2>
		<p>Hello! What's all this here? A <a data-tooltip="Unfashionable, garish" class="tooltipdata">kitschy</a> vase <br> some <a data-tooltip="Temple was a former child star known for her cutesy dresses and blonde curls - a reference to how Grayson Perry (the potter, pictured below) often cross-dresses, with 'kitschy' make-up and hair" class="tooltipdata">Shirley Temple</a> manqu√© has knocked out <br> delineating tales of
			kids in cars <br> on <a data-tooltip="Housing estates often built to house working class families, and viewed by the middle classes as hubs for anti-social behaviour" class="tooltipdata">crap estates</a>, <a data-tooltip="Burberry - at the time of this poem - had a reputation as the unofficial uniform of the 'chav'. It was associated with violent, anti-social behaviour, and used as a by-word in popular culture to criticise (generally) working-class youth behaving badly. 
			&#13; &#10; &#13;  'Louts' is one slang term used to describe these people. &#13; &#10; &#13; 
			The company has since performed something of a rebranding miracle (in no small part due to gargantuan spending on global advertising campaigns)." class="tooltipdata">the Burberry clad louts</a><br> who flail their motors through the smoky night <br>
			from <a data-tooltip="These are all towns in the Midlands and the North, generally coded as working-class." class="tooltipdata">Manchester to Motherwell or Slough</a>, <br> creating bedlam on the Queen's highway. <br> Your gaudy evocation can,
			somehow, <br> conjure the scene without inducing fright, <br> as would a <a data-tooltip="One of Britain's major tabloid newspapers, perennially obsessed with 'anti-social behaviour' of louts" class="tooltipdata">Daily Express</a>. expos√©, <br> can bring to
			mind the throaty turbo roar <br> of hatchbacks tuned almost to breaking point, <br> the joyful throb of UK garage or
			<br> of <a data-tooltip="Garage and House are both styles of dance music, again associated with anti-social behaviour" class="tooltipdata">house</a>. imported from the continent <br> and yet educe a sense of peace, of calm - <br> the screech of tyres 
			and the nervous squeals <br> of girls, too young to quite appreciate <br> the peril they are in, are heard, but
			these wheels <br> will not lose traction, skid and flip, no harm <br> befall these children. They will stay out late <br><br>
			 forever, pumped on youth and ecstasy, <br> on alloy, bass and arrogance, and speed <br> the back lanes,
			the urban gyratory, <br> the wide motorways, never having need <br> to race back home, for work next day, to bed.
			<br> Each girl is <a data-tooltip="Another word for attractive" class="tooltipdata">buff</a>, each <a data-tooltip="Slang for a man" class="tooltipdata">geezer</a> toned and strong, <br> charged with pulsing juice which, even yet, <br> fills
			every pair of Calvin‚Äôs and each thong, <br> never to be deflated, given head <br> in crude games of <a data-tooltip="A particularly vulgar metaphor, suggesting the risks involved with unprotected sexual activity."  class="tooltipdata">chlamydia  roulette.</a><br><br>Now see who comes to line the sparse grass verge, <br> to toast them in <a data-tooltip="A very strong, very cheap alcohol" class="tooltipdata">Buckfast</a> and <a data-tooltip="Another equally cheap and strong alcoholic drink, again favoured by those seeking inebriation rather than flavour." class="tooltipdata">Diamond White</a>:
			<br> rat-boys and corn-rowed cheerleaders who urge <br> them on to pull more burn-outs or to write <br> their <a data-tooltip="The tyre marks left by spinning your wheels deliberately in a circle" class="tooltipdata">donut</a>
			Os, as signature, upon <br> the bleached tarmac of dead suburban streets. <br> There dogs set up a row and curtains
			twitch <br> as pensioners and parents telephone <br> the cops to plead for quiet, sue for peace - <br> tranquility,
			though, is for the rich. <br><br> And so, millennia hence, you garish crock, <br> when all context is lost, galleries
			razed <br> to level dust and we're long in the box, <br> will future poets look on you amazed, <br> speculate how
			children might have lived when <br> you were fired, lives so free and bountiful <br> and there, beneath a sun a
			little colder, <br> declare How happy were those creatures then, <br> who knew the truth was all negotiable <br> and
			<a data-tooltip="The central idea from Keats's 'Ode to  Graecian Urn' (see the link in Q1)" class="tooltipdata">beauty in the gift of the beholder.</a>.</p>
