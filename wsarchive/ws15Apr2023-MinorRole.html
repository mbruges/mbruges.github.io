		<h2>A Minor Role</h2>
		<p>I’m best observed on stage, <br> <a data-tooltip="'Spear-carrier' is traditionally the most minor role an actor can have in a play - usually standing around at the back while the 'proper' actors get on with the real drama'" class="tooltipdata">Propping a spear</a>, or making endless <br> Exits and entrances with my servant’s <br>
			patter, Yes, sir. O no, sir. If I get <br> These midget moments wrong, the monstrous fabric <br> Shrinks to unwanted
			sniggers.<br><br>But my heart’s in the unobtrusive, <br> The waiting-room roles: driving to hospitals, <br> Parking
			at hospitals. Holding hands under <br> Veteran magazines; making sense <br> Of consultants’ monologues; asking
			pointed <br> Questions politely; checking dosages, <br> Dates; getting on terms with receptionists; <br> Sustaining
			the background music of civility. <br> At home in the street you may see me <br> Walking fast in case anyone stops:
			<br> getting on, getting better my formula <br> For well-meant intrusiveness.<br><br>At home, <br> Thinking ahead:
			Bed? A good idea! <br> (Bed solves a lot); answer the phone, <br> Be wary what I say to it, but grateful always;
			<br> Contrive meals for hunger-striker; track down <br> Whimsical soft-centred happy-all-the-way-through novels;
			<br> Find the cat (mysteriously reassuring); <br> Cancel things; pretend all’s well, <br> Admit it’s not. Learn to
			conjugate all the genres of misery: <br> Tears, torpor, boredom, lassitude, yearnings <br> For a simpler illness,
			like a broken leg. <br> Enduring ceremonial delays. Being referred <br> Somewhere else. Consultant’s holiday. Saying
			Thank you, <br> For anything to everyone <br> Not the star part.<br><br>And who would want it? I jettison the spear,
			<br> The servant’s try, the terrible drone of Chorus: <br> Yet to my thinking this act was ill advised <br> <a data-tooltip="This is a line taken from Oedipus Rex - a classical tragedy - and spoken by the Chorus" class="tooltipdata">It would have been better to die</a>. No it wouldn’t! <br> I am here to make you believe in life.</p>
