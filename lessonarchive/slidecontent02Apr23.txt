  <h1>Black Holes</h1>
  <p>A black hole is a region in which the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed when massive stars run out of fuel and collapse.</p>
  <h2>Key Terms:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Event Horizon: the boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing can escape</li>
    <li>Singularity: a point of infinite density at the center of a black hole where the laws of physics as we know them break down</li>
    <li>Spaghettification: the stretching of an object into a long, thin shape in the strong gravitational field near a black hole</li>
  </ul>
