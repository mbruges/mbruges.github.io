<!-- After quite a lot of faffing, the most elegant solution is the following:
1) Write blogposts in Markdown (using the Rich Markdown Editor extension)
2) Insert these posts using zeroMD script, which requires:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs@2/webcomponents-loader.min.js"></script>

    and

    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zerodevx/zero-md@1/src/zero-md.min.js"></script>

3) Set the required blogpost in a div using the following :

<zero-md src="./blogarchive/POSTTITLE.md"></zero-md>

        <h2>Hello World</h2>
        <h3>Teachers don‚Äôt do much learning.</h3>
        <p>That‚Äôs perhaps unfair - hardly anyone, really, does much learning past the age of 24 or 25. I don‚Äôt mean in the self-knowledge, incremental gains kind of way; I mean in the taking on of a fundamentally new skill or new domain, something you don‚Äôt already do. </p>
        <p>Certainly, we sit through plenty of CPD (of varying quality). But this is often either something we know already, something we‚Äôve forgotten and need to be (legally) reminded of on a periodic basis, or some system that changes something we were doing already.</p>
        <p>The rarity of genuinely new experiences is, I think, one of the things that hampers us from truly understanding the mind-bendingly difficult process our students go through 5 times a day, every day: being confronted with something you don‚Äôt know yet, and being unsure quite how you‚Äôll ever get to the stage of fully understanding it.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs remarkable, really: it‚Äôs as though we experience collective amnesia about those horrendous few terms in Year 9 when first confronted with algebraic equations, or that torturous double period on a Thursday as a well-meaning <i>madame</i> patiently explained the past participle for the <i>soixante-dix</i> time. As though we‚Äôve agreed to never speak of them again, and certainly not re-live the emotions. </p>
        <p>But ever a glutton for punishment, I have thrown myself back into the unforgiving maw of learning, willingly. And this site, then, is where you can see the half-ripened fruits of that labour.</p>
        <h3>Fitting your own lightbulbs</h3>
            <p>My first, and over-riding feeling? Satisfaction. My god is it satisfying to get something, to go from clueless to
            clueful. In that one brief moment (before you see the Dunning-Kruger pit gaping ahead of you) the fabric of space and
            time opens up and you are master of the universe. You have, through your own fleshy grey matter, taken <i>something</i> that
            was meaningless and rendered it meaningful. Where that was darkness, light; where there was fear, understanding.</p>
            <p>The second feeling, hot on satisfaction‚Äôs heels: worry. Because one must then ask the question: how often do my students
            feel this? This burning, satisfied pride that comes from accumulating another brick of knowledge on their little pyramid
            of progress? Do they ever? Do I celebrate it when I see it? <i>Can</i> I see it?</p>
            <p>When interviewing teachers, one of the most best questions you can ask is: what‚Äôs been your favourite moment in the
            classroom? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the answer will be this. The ‚Äòlight-bulb‚Äô moment of understanding, going
            off in the student (usually recalcitrant, usually male), which briefly illuminates the narrow path ahead of them and
            makes it seem achievable.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we can all benefit from living a moment like this ourselves. Fit your own lightbulbs; remember what it feels like.</p>
            <h3>Just do it</h3>
            <p>The best way to learn is to do. One can read, highlight, bulletpoint, mind-map in a beautifully Pinterest-able notebook,
            but if you want to form and solidifying those synaptic connections, you need to actually practice. And practice that
            <i>produces</i> something is even better.</p>
            <p>Knowing that anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a browser can access what you show is another excellent motivator.</p>
            <p>
            Having faffed around with Javascript and a little Python, there‚Äôs a great deal to be said for solidifying the nebulous
            world of monospaced type on a black screen into something more tangible and designed.</p>
            This site is less a showcase or portfolio, and more a sketchbook. There are lots of ideas here in various states of
            completion. Some are demos at 99% functionality, some are projects I‚Äôve put on ice for the foreseeable, and some are
            abominations of half-formed code that really ought to be put out of their misery.</p>
            <p>
            But each one represents one of those lightbulbs. And even if they only give off a flicker, they‚Äôre worth keeping around.</p>
