            <p>As it says <a href="mbruges.com/index.html" target="_blank">on the tin</a>: I‚Äôm a teacher. It‚Äôs an
                incredible career, and one I‚Äôm proud of.</p>
            <p>But a niggling feeling started at the back of my mind a few months ago.</p>
            <p><em>Teachers don't do much learning.</em></p>
            <p>That‚Äôs perhaps unfair - hardly anyone, really, does much learning <a
                    href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3045424/what-it-takes-to-change-your-brains-patterns-after-age-25"
                    target="_blank"> past the age of 25</a>. I don‚Äôt mean in the
                self-knowledge, incremental gains kind of way; I mean in the taking on of a fundamentally new skill or
                new domain,
                something you don‚Äôt already do.</p>
            <p>Certainly, we sit through plenty of CPD (of <a
                    href="https://www.tes.com/magazine/analysis/general/why-better-cpd-could-be-answer-teacher-retention"
                    target="_blank">varying quality</a>). But this is often either something we know already,
                something we've forgotten and need to be (legally) reminded of on a periodic basis, or some system that
                changes
                something we were doing already.</p>
            <h1 class="atx" id="learning-is-hard">Learning is hard</h1>
            <p>The rarity of genuinely new experiences is, I think, one of the things that hampers us from truly
                understanding the
                mind-bendingly difficult process our students go through 5 times a day, every day: being confronted with
                something
                you don‚Äôt know yet, and being unsure quite how you‚Äôll ever get to the stage of fully understanding it.
            </p>
            <p>It‚Äôs remarkable, really. It‚Äôs as though we experience collective amnesia about those horrendous few terms
                in Year 9
                when first confronted with algebraic equations, or that torturous double period on a Thursday as a
                well-meaning
                <em>madame</em> patiently explained the past participle for the <em>soixante-dix</em> time. As though
                we've agreed
                to never speak of them again, and certainly not re-live the emotions.
            </p>
            <p>But ever a glutton for punishment, I have thrown myself back into the unforgiving maw of learning,
                willingly.</p>
            <p><a href="http://mbruges.com/" target="_blank">This website you‚Äôre on right now</a> - in all its
                hacked-together glory - represents the
                half-ripened fruits of that process.</p>
            <h1 class="atx" id="fit-your-own-lightbulbs">Fit your own lightbulbs</h1>
            <p>My first, and over-riding feeling? Satisfaction. My god is it satisfying to get something, to go from
                clueless to
                clue-full. In that one brief moment (before you see the Dunning-Kruger pit gaping ahead of you) the
                fabric of space
                and time opens up and you are master of the universe. You have, through your own fleshy grey matter,
                taken something
                that was meaningless and rendered it meaningful. Where that was darkness, light; where there was fear,
                understanding.</p>
            <p>The second feeling, hot on satisfaction‚Äôs heels: worry. Because one must then ask the question: how often
                do my
                students feel this? This burning, satisfied pride that comes from accumulating another brick of
                knowledge on their
                little pyramid of progress? Do they ever? Do I celebrate it when I see it? Can <em>I</em> see it?</p>
            <p>When interviewing teachers, one of the most best questions you can ask is: what‚Äôs been your favourite
                moment in the
                classroom? Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the answer will be this. The ‚Äòlight-bulb‚Äô moment of
                understanding,
                going off in the student (usually recalcitrant, usually male), which briefly illuminates the narrow path
                ahead of
                them and makes it seem achievable.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we can all benefit from living a moment like this ourselves. Fit your own lightbulbs; remember
                what it feels
                like.</p>
            <h1 class="atx" id="just-do-it">Just do it</h1>
            <p>The best way to learn is to do. One can read, highlight, bulletpoint, mind-map in a beautifully <a
                    href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22538703/tiktok-productivity-hacks-gen-z"
                    target="_blank">Pinterest-able notebook</a>, but
                if you want to form and solidifying those synaptic connections, you need to actually practice. And
                practice that
                produces something is even better.</p>
            <p>Knowing that anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a browser can access what you show is another excellent
                motivator.
            </p>
            <p>Having faffed around with Javascript and a little Python, there‚Äôs a great deal to be said for solidifying
                the
                nebulous world of monospaced type on a black screen into something more tangible and designed.</p>
            <p>This site is less a <a href="https://mbruges.com/scriptpractice.html" target="_blank">showcase</a> or
                portfolio, and more a
                sketchbook. There are lots of ideas here in various states of completion. Some are <a
                    href="https://mbruges.com/wotd.html" target="_blank">demos at 99% functionality</a>, some are <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1s44mmlysg8G7lLW5QvGb5?si=5889d05e4c8a4171"
                    target="_blank">projects I've put on ice</a> for
                the foreseeable, and some are <a href="https://mbruges.com/scriptpractice.html"
                    target="_blank">abominations of half-formed code</a>
                that really ought to be put out of their misery.</p>
            <p>But each one represents one of those lightbulbs. And even if they only give off a flicker, they‚Äôre worth
                keeping
                around.</p>
