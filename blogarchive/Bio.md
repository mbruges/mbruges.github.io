## It's nice to meet you.

...though unless you're *very* tenacious with your Googling, we've probably met already.

I built this website largely as a place to practice my coding and to learn new skills (the details of which I will bore you with [here](http://mbruges.com/blog)). So poke around and try some of the [experiments](/experiments.html). Feel free to download and use the [resources](/resources.html), too.

I have been Head of English for a few years now, long enough to know that we can always be doing more to experiment and improve. Hopefully, what you find here will help you to do just that.

If you'd like to chat, you can drop me an email.
